# KeyTree

KeyTree manages trees of hashes, and (possibly nested) forests of such trees,
allowing access to values by key path.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'key_tree'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install key_tree

## Usage

```ruby
kt=KeyTree::Tree[a: { b: 1 }]
kt['a.b']
=> 1
kf=KeyTree::Forest[kt, {b: { c: 2 }}]
kt['a.b']
=> 1
kf['b.c']
=> 2
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.
